# FaceGuard Image Augmentation

## Introduction
This is the image augmentation for FaceGuard. The final folder has to be feed into our other scripts.


## Requirements
As some experiments forced us to move to the Google Cloud Platform for Image Augmentation, we can only confirm this to be working on Google Cloud using the Image pytorch-latest-gpu. No special packages had to be installed.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine (or any other server you would like to run it on)
2. Clone the MaskTheFace package
```
cd ./util
git clone https://github.com/aqeelanwar/MaskTheFace.git
```
3. Open the Dataset_Download_Augmentation Notebook and execute the steps

## Alternative Files
In case you just want to get started, we have prepared the Augmented dataset as download link.
Please note, that this is the "advanced dataset" of our presentation, which does not include mask augmentation.
