# FaceGuard Frontend

## Introduction
This is the Frontend for FaceGuard. It is important to mention that this is just a MVP.
Therefore, the shown functionalities are fully functional, but might need some improvements (e.g. hardening) for production environments.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine (or any other server you would like to run it on). Make sure you have nodeJS and npm installed.
2. Install all required packages
```bash
npm i
```
4. Run the Frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```
5.The frontend will be available on port 8000 after starting. Please note, that it is required to have the backend run on port 8000 on the same machine.
If you would like to change this, have a look at config/proxy.ts
